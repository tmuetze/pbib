### Story behind the code 
The code was born from a need to get stuff quicky. And the fact that in most cases there will be someone very close to you who is willing to lend that stuff. 


### What inspired us?
Two of the team members are environmental engineers: borrowing items is far more sustainable than buying them. Especially items you'll only use once in a while, or that you are buying just because you forgot yours at home...

### Target users
Hackathon hackers, for now. Soon even your grandma will be using pbib.it. 

### Key features we're most proud of
* You'll find the closest person to you - saving everyone time and energy 
* When you're matched with a borrower/lender, you find one another by waving your phones in the air that will be displaying matching colours on the screens 
* As part of pbib.it's aunch, we're lending out our air bed for that post-hackathon slump
